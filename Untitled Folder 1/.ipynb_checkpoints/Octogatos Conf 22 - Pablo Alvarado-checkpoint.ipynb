    "\n",
    "### Mario Ashley Rodriguez Caballero -  KeyNote\n",
    "\n",
    "Mario started his conference by presenting himself, highlighting the whole journey that he had to live through in order to establish in the USA coming from Cuba and currently working as a VP of Product at Github. Letting all of us know that there is a lot NOT said in that journey, and despite it being hard for some of us, there are different factors that can contribute in our journey, and this is the main objective of Mario in this conference.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Influence your Future: As we all know, we cannot determine our future, but each of us can control our emotions and actions to influence in the results and therefore, our future. And Mario makes this idea reallly clear by highlighting both accomplishments and failures in his carrer. Concluding that we need to take risks, stay curious and keep learning, in order to grow our mindset wihtout the fear of failing or being rejected. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Put Something Back: On this section, he started to denotate that in the bigger picture, most of the Software development comes from the contributions of many. Which is why he encounters that a key factor is to return and contribute our own developments into the society. Relating this part with one of the main objectives of Github, and which is to have a free open source of information, that anyone can take advantage of or contribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Lead with Clarity and Energy: Finally, Mario higlighted how he has became a leader and the main aspects that any of us need to consider for project management or even any leading application. He mentioned that the main aspects that make a leader is to lead with clarity and Energy. Which allows us to create an environment where everyone does their best work, by inspiring optimism, creativity and growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, despite that Mario did not gave a conference directly related to coding or software development in general, I consider that the topics that he mentioned, are key for any of us, as those experiences will help us in the future to know what is needed if we want success, and which are the best ways to accomplish it.\n",

    "### A capability framework for product engineering teams - Juan Pablo @buritica\n",
    "\n",
    "As we all know, programming is mostly an individual activity, while building software products is a social one. Collaboration is an emergent property of teams and team effectiveness doesn't fall solely on management. If we can have competency frameworks for individuals, why can't we establish one for teams? This is the main idea that Juan Pablo wants to transmit inside his conferences, dividing it in key factors that validates his ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Capabilities help us establish expectations as outcomes, and ownership over path enables autonomy. In this context a framework allows the team to focus on results. Therefore, Juan Pablo established a framework that describes what a capable product engineering team must be able to do:\n",
    "1. Navigate ambiguity.\n",
    "•\tFind valuable work instead of idling waiting for direction.\n",
    "•\tFind the right places and people to ask questions.\n",
    "•\tAsk clarifying questions and seek aligment.\n",
    "2. Set Goals:\n",
    "•\tDefine outcomes that align with overall strategy.\n",
    "•\tEstablish goals that are measurable and achievable.\n",
    "•\tCommunicate engineering approaches effectively through business outcomes.\n",
    "3. Ask for help:\n",
    "•\tRaise their hands with concrete requests for help.\n",
    "•\tSurface needs without waiting for meetings or expiring deadlines.\n",
    "•\tOffer alternative resolutions and negotiate if necessary.\n",
    "4. Broadcast state:\n",
    "•\tEstablish or use distribution channels for status reporting.\n",
    "•\tCommunicate \"at risk\" or \"off track\" status proactively, ideally with resolution plans.\n",
    "•\tMinimize surprises on dependent teams or leadership.\n",
    "5. Negotiate dependencies:\n",
    "•\tProactively track and align dependencies across teams.\n",
    "•\tCommunicate changes and priority shifts.\n",
    "•\tFacilitate contributions across codebases as needed to reduce coupling.\n",
    "6. Escalate appropriately:\n",
    "•\tStart by communicating directly with cross-functional peers.\n",
    "•\tDocument the conflict, possible resolutions and existing discussions.\n",
    "•\tEscalate through established channels, leaning on leadership to tie-break and take responsibility for outcomes.\n",
    "7. Manage it's capacity:\n",
    "•\tUnderstand its distribution across maintain, support & feature building.\n",
    "•\tBalance accordingly, accelerating tempo without overworking.\n",
    "•\tConsistently deliver on 80%+ of planned work.\n",
    "8. onboard team members:\n",
    "•\tEnable new (or visiting) team-members to feel comfortable and productive quickly.\n",
    "•\tEstablish self-service environment with support channels.\n",
    "•\tEncourage and reward team members who continuously improve onboarding for future members.\n",
    "9. Understand it's users:\n",
    "•\tHas collective familiarity over needs. \n",
    "•\tPrioritize across perceived and demonstrated friction.\n",
    "•\tHas established user feedback channels.\n",
    "10. Understand it's levers:\n",
    "•\tConnect organizational business goals to day to day work.\n",
    "•\tInvest appropriately in impactful work.\n",
    "•\tTranslate \"technical debt\" to business impact. \n",
    "11. Tell it's story:\n",
    "•\tConstantly sharing the narrative that contextualizes work.\n",
    "•\tInfluence peer teams to use similar language and connect goals.\n",
    "•\tPersistent \"political campaign\"\n",
    "12. Define working agreements:\n",
    "•\tDiscuss and negotiate ways of working that serve team-members.\n",
    "•\tIterate on established agreements as team evolves. \n",
    "•\tAdopt sensible organizational defaults to facilitate predictable cadence.\n",
    "13. Adopt an operational cadence:\n",
    "•\tConverge on organizational rhythm. \n",
    "•\tFacilitate team observability.\n",
    "•\tLean on predictable tempo to facilitate focus\n",
    "14. Anticipate problems:\n",
    "•\tUse monitoring, alerting and other tools to observe and react.\n",
    "•\tInstrument perceived friction to validate effort investments.\n",
    "•\tPlan and document releases effectively. \n",
    "•\tAwareness over important organizational events. \n",
    "15. Respond to incidents:\n",
    "•\tEstablish, documented, on-call and paging procedures. \n",
    "•\tCreate and curate run-books reducing ambiguity and anxiety. \n",
    "•\tConfidently escalate and page as needed.\n",
    "•\tCommunicate response state clearly and in a timely manner. \n",
    "16. Improve on it's processes:\n",
    "•\tContinuously evaluates what's working well and what can improve.\n",
    "•\tImprovement isn't restricted or solely directed by management.\n",
    "•\tEmpowers team to develop tooling that eliminates toil.\n",
    "17. Tackle increasing complexity:\n",
    "•\tConsistently reduce risk of increasingly larger projects. \n",
    "•\tShift from following to driving strategy.\n",
    "•\tOperating and executing on expanding or simultaneous horizons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite it presenting us a broad description of a framework that will improve a team effectivenes, the main objective of this conference was to highlight the need of understanding the complexity in team relations, and how each member and leader needs to work in a define and coherent environment. Which is why, Juan Pablo encourages us to consider the main topics of a a capable team must be capable of.\n",

    "### Towards a responsible artificial intelligence - Carla Mamani y Luis Beltrán\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial intelligence nowadays has become a recurrent topic and idea that not only demonstrates the great power that software development has, but, encourages each of us by setting realistic objectives that will then generate huge impacts in our society. However, as we all know, with great power comes great responsability. And this idea is exactly what this conference wants to transmit to us, as artificial intelligence has established as something \"normal\" in our lives. \n",
    "\n",
    "The conference starts by highlighting how the bast majority of people do not trust artificial intelligence or even think that it is responsible. After this, the principles of a responsible AI were established: \n",
    "1. Fairness: Looks for the absence of negative impacts on groups based on sensitive characteristics such as gender, age, origin and others. However, in order to accomplish this, it is required to create parity restrictions, that will not allow to make relations for negative impacts.\n",
    "2. Reliability and security: We have to have robust monitoring and follow-up procedures to modeling so that the performance of the model is optimal. Also, sensitive information of the users must be taken into account in order to avoid any serious security issue.\n",
    "3. Privacy: The models must not enter information that it was not previously allowed, in order to mantain a certain level of privacy.\n",
    "4. Inclusion: We have to design an AI that is undiscriminatory but also we have the ticket to account the fact that the world around us is very diverse we have people with disabilities or thank you basically AI systems need to be inclusive and they have to be in tune with the needs of our diverse ecosystem when artificial intelligence systems.\n",
    "5. Transparency and responsability: There must be packages that contribute to the transparency and explainability of a model, such us: Interpret-community, InterpretML, Fairlearn. Also, responsability of the owners of each model and what it causes is essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we also have a \"Responsible AI Toolbox\" that allows to analyze our models by having available:\n",
    "1. Responsible AI Dashboard\n",
    "2. Fairness Dashboard\n",
    "3. Error Analysis Dashboard\n",
    "4. Interpretability Dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, there are a lot of things and aspects to consider if we want to be responsible with AI, and despite the conference gave us a lot of detailed information on its importance and how to apply, we also have some general recommendations such us:\n",
    "1. Clarify what the smart system is going to do\n",
    "2. Clarify system performance\n",
    "3. Display relevant contextual information\n",
